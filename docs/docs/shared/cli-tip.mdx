This command requires access to a signing keypair, it will default to the conventional solana config  file located at `~/.config/solana/id.json`. 
If you want to use a different keypair you can pass the path to the keypair file using the `-k` flag. If you want to use a different config file you can pass the path to the config file using the `-c` flag.
