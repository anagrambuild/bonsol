# General Contributing Guide

Welcome! We're glad you're here. Before we get started, let's make sure everyone is using the same tools.

乃ㄖ几丂ㄖㄥ relies on multiple toolchains, and that can cause issues between developer environments. We recommend using Nix in order to alleviate the issue.
The nix flake in the root of the project provides a layer of safety by locking in the versions of packages provided by solana, risc0, rust, node
and any other tools that are necessary to build all of the goodness that is 乃ㄖ几丂ㄖㄥ.

## Getting Started

> NOTE: Currently only supported on `x86_64-linux` machines, this will eventually change to support other architectures.

### Fork and Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/bonsol.git
cd bonsol
```

### Required Dependencies
<PrereqContrib />

### Testing Your Environment

```bash
solana --version
cargo --version
rustc --version
```

Great! Our tools are there. Let's run the `simple` example already provided from the README to make sure our environment is working properly.  

#### Prerequisites
If this is your first time running bonsol install the Risc0 Groth16 Prover:
```bash
./bin/install_prover.sh --prefix .
```

The solona cli must be configured. This configuration is typically found in `${HOME}/.config/solana/cli/config.yml`
```bash
cat >> ${HOME}/.config/solana/cli/config.yml <<EOF
json_rpc_url: https://localhost:9900
websocket_url: ""
keypair_path: /home/solana/.config/solana/id.json
commitment: confirmed
EOF
```

A solana account is also required.  This can be generated easily.
```bash
solana-keygen new -o ${HOME}/.config/solana/id.json
```

1. Download and setup the system with the needed binaries and keys to run the groth16 prover over the risc0 FRI
```bash
./bin/setup.sh --prefix .
```
2. Compile the 乃ㄖ几丂ㄖㄥ on chain program and start a localnet with the program loaded
```bash
./bin/validator.sh -r
```
3. On a separate terminal, compile the 乃ㄖ几丂ㄖㄥ off-chain node and start it
```bash
./bin/run-node.sh
```
4. Build the image binary if it hasn't already been built, this will result in the binary's path being available in the `manifest.json` (in this case `images/simple/manifest.json`)
```bash
cargo run -p bonsol-cli build -z images/simple
```
5. Use the bonsol cli to deploy a zkprogram (here is a example already uploaded for you)
```bash
cargo run -p bonsol-cli deploy url -m images/simple/manifest.json --url https://bonsol-public-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/simple-68f4b0c5f9ce034aa60ceb264a18d6c410a3af68fafd931bcfd9ebe7c1e42960
```
6. Use the bonsol cli to execute a zkprogram
```bash
cargo run -p bonsol-cli execute -f testing-examples/example-execution-request.json -x 2000 -m 2000 -w
```

## Installing Risc0 Groth16 Location

The `install_prover.sh` script automates the installation of RISC Zero prover by downloading required files from a specified provider URL and saving them to a defined installation prefix.

### Running the Script

To use the script, run it with the following command:

```bash
./bin/install_prover.sh [OPTIONS]
```

### Available Options

- `--prefix <install location>`: Specifies the directory where the RISC Zero prover technologies will be installed.  
  **Default**: `/opt/risc0-prover`.

- `--prover-provider-url <prover provider URL>`: URL from which the prover files will be downloaded.  
  **Default**: `http://risc0-prover-us-east-1-041119533185.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

- `--job-timeout <timeout>`: Maximum time allowed for each download, in seconds.  
  **Default**: 3600 seconds (1 hour).

- `--version <prover version>`: Specifies the version of the prover to install.  
  **Default**: `v2024-05-17.1`.

- `--help`: Displays a help message with usage instructions.

### Example

To install the prover to /usr/local/risc0 with a custom prover provider URL and a timeout of 1800 seconds:

```bash
./install_prover.sh --prefix /usr/local/risc0 --prover-provider-url http://custom-url.com --job-timeout 1800
```

### Prerequisites

	•	`curl`: Ensure that curl is installed on your system, as it is required for downloading the files. If curl is not available, the script will terminate with an error.

### Installation Process

The script will:

	1.	Parse the provided arguments or use default values.
	2.	Create the installation directory if it doesn’t exist.
	3.	Download the necessary prover files (such as stark/rapidsnark and stark/stark_verify) from the prover provider URL.
	4.	If the files already exist, they will be skipped to avoid redundant downloads.



## Pull Requests

Thank you for your hard work! It's well appreciated (: Most of our code quality standards can be kept up-to-code by running `nix flake check` and following the prompts.

Otherwise refer to this checklist:

- [] Before filing an issue, please check if an existing issue matches the description of the problem you are having or feature you'd like to see implemented.
- [] Please ensure when upstreaming pull requests that the problem you are solving has a corresponding GitHub issue, and that the issue is linked in the PR description with closing keywords, eg. `Closes #1578`.
- [] Add a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR description.
- [] Add relevant tests that showcase the effectiveness of your changes, where applicable.
- [] GitHub action CI will run the same checks in the nix sandbox that you can run locally on your machine with `nix flake check`, which may be helpful in diagnosing issues before pushing changes.
- [] Please format your rust code with the cargo nightly formatter as some options require it: `cargo +nightly fmt`, and format toml files with `taplo fmt`.
- [] When adding dependencies, please be cautious that the dependency is well maintained and does not create a security vulnerability. The flake checks will prevent this, and `cargo deny` can give other safe options to choose from.
- [] Ensure your PR is not introducing new lints: `cargo clippy`.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use **commitlint** to ensure that all commit messages follow a consistent style based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification. This makes it easier to understand the history of the project and generate changelogs automatically.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message must be structured as follows:
#### Type

The type must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

#### Scope

The scope is optional and provides additional context about what the commit affects (e.g., `api`, `cli`, `frontend`, etc.).

#### Description

The description is a short, imperative summary of the change. It should start with a verb and be written in the present tense (e.g., "add feature," "fix bug").

#### Body (optional)

The body of the commit message provides additional details about the change. Use this when the change is not trivial and requires more explanation.

#### Footer (optional)

The footer should contain any relevant information about breaking changes or issues being closed:

- Breaking changes should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:`, followed by an explanation of what changed and why.
- Issues should be referenced using the `Closes` keyword, like so: `Closes #123`.

### Example Commit Messages

```text
feat(api): add user authentication
```

```text
fix(auth): correct token expiration logic
```

```text
docs: update README with new installation steps
```

```text
chore: update dependencies
```

## Troubleshooting

- Docker Permissions: Adding your user to the `docker` group may help -- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

- Invalid Keypair: You need to generate a solana keypair, which you can check for at `~/.config/solana/id.json`. Generate a new keypair with `solana-keygen new` if it's missing.

- Keypair Not Found: If your keypair isn't automatically found, you can pass the keypair and RPC URL to the `bonsol-cli` invocation like so:

```bash
cargo run -p bonsol-cli -- --keypair $HOME/.config/solana/id.json --rpc-url http://localhost:8899 build -z images/simple
```
